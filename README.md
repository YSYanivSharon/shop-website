You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Nextjs

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Tailwindcss

- To stylize the app, read about [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes)
- If you want to use the same class for many elements, consider adding that to the /app/globals.css file instead.

## HeadlessUI

- Some ui components are available with [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/). Try to use them instead of implementing stuff by yourself.

## Heroicons

- We can use icons from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). You can see an example in the /app/components/shop-header.tsx file.
